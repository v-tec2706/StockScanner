# StockScanner
This project provide simple tool which is able to parse values from stock quotes. It is created in educational purposes, to let me get more familiar
with `Scala` and `Spark` technologies. So, more emphasis was put on this tools, and how to use them rather than functionality or meaningfulness of project.
